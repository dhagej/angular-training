# Presentation of Angular

## What is Angular ?
Angular is more than just a frontend framework with which to build Single Page Applications (SPA). It is a full-fledged development platform built on TypeScript that comprises:

- A component-based framework for building scalable web applications.
- A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features including routing, form management, client-server communication, progressive web apps and more.
- A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code via the Angular CLI.

Angular presents numerous advantages:
- It is particularly well suited to projects that need to scale and to that effect, it is mainly used for enterprise projects.
- Its rich official library ecosystem enables great consistency across projects, which means that when transferring teams or projects you will only need to learn about the new business domain and not an entirely new way of doing things because another set of libraries were chosen.
- It is very well documented and the consistency in the way the framework is used means you are more than likely to find any question you may encounter along your learning journey already answered.
- The Angular team takes a lot of pride in how easy they make updating an Angular projects, providing easy steps to follow and some fully automated migration.
